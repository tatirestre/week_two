	</strong>Strong background in Mathematical Programming with more than four years of experience leading large data optimization projects for applications in fields including: transportation, imaging, social networks, and machine learning. Has designed and developed APIs that range from new optimization algorithms, to dashboards for business intelligence. In addition, has worked in Semantic Search technologies, including projects that classifies and disambiguates the meaning of contextualized search keywords. Constantly motivated by the challenges of dealing with highly complex problems and creating efficient data-driven solutions.

<div style="direction: ltr;"><strong>BIO
</strong>Camilo obtained Bachelor’s degrees in <a href="http://sistemas.uniandes.edu.co/" target="_blank">System and Computer Engineering</a> and <a href="http://matematicas.uniandes.edu.co/" target="_blank">Mathematics</a>, with a minor in Applied Mathematics at the <a href="http://www.uniandes.edu.co/" target="_blank">Universidad de los Andes</a> in 2006. Then, Camilo and his brother started a software company (later acquired by <a href="http://siigo.com" target="_blank">Siigo</a>) which develops Balanced ScoreCard (BSC) applications to increase productivity for small and medium-sized Colombian businesses.  In 2007, a full scholarship from the Universidad de los Andes enabled Camilo to obtain a Master’s degree in <a href="http://industrial.uniandes.edu.co" target="_blank">Industrial Engineering</a> with a concentration in Operations Research and Statistics in 2007.

In 2008, he obtained the <a href="http://scienceandtech.fulbrightonline.org/" target="_blank">Fulbright Science &amp; Technology Award</a> to continue his studies with a PhD at the School of <a href="http://www.isye.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE)</a> at <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Tech</a>. After six years at ISyE, Camilo obtained MS and PhD degrees in Operations Research leading research projects developing new algorithms for efficiently solving large-scale convex optimization problems. He obtained the <a href="http://arc.gatech.edu/research/fellowships" target="_blank">ARC fellowship</a> in 2011, Ligon Fund Award in 2013, and <a href="http://omed.gatech.edu" target="_blank">OMED Tower Awards</a> in 2011 and 2014.

Then, in 2015 he worked as a Data Scientist at CareerBuilder (the largest online job site in the United States), modeling semantically related search terms to develop algorithms for named entity disambiguation  with the purpose of improving the accuracy (precision and recall) of the recommendation systems and search engines leveraged by job seekers and employers. Since November 2015, Camilo joined the AI and NLP Foundations team at <a href="http://bloomberglabs.com" target="_blank">Bloomberg Labs</a>.
